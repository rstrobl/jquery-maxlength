This plugin allows you to attach a counter to any input field that has a restricted length. The counter shows the remaining characters of input fields. It is required to define the maxlength attribute for the field.

Usage:

$("textarea").maxlength({
	'showmax': true,			// shows maxlength in counter, default: false
	'class': 'counter',			// defines class for counter
	'text': 'characters remaining'		// attaches text to counter value
});
